## Abstract

Librarians are increasingly concerned with promoting and supporting research reproducibility on their campuses. However, if librarians want to encourage researchers to use reproducible practices, we should also be using reproducible practices in our own work. For librarians who work with library collections data, there is an obvious opportunity to practice reproducible behaviors. Making collections data analysis more repeatable improves librarians' work by reducing time and increasing consistency. It also gives them more empathy for what researchers experience as they attempt to move their current research behaviors in a more reproducible direction. In this lightning talk, we will describe and share templates we have created for documenting our own collections analysis projects. The templates were made with open source tools including Markdown and R, which are often recommended to researchers.
